- config passing:
    - pass whole config objects and let the managers pull out the config vs
    - pass specific subsets of config and whole config objects vs
    - just pass the specific subset of the config

- entity drawing
    - every entity draws themselves
    - the map tells entities to draw themselves
    - entities update their respective tiles and tell the map to draw all the tiles
    - some other kind of manager draws both
    - as of october 4th 2017, going with:
        - mapmanager is no longer going to really be a thing
          - well, it should be for clamping objects etc, and multiple maps
        - rendermanager is going to draw a list of things that are registered with it
        - entitymanager is going to issue updates to all entities and update their representations that are registered with the rendermanager
        - entitymanager can get you the player entity and will call the player's update function, and maybe .. player manager won't even be a thing now
        - a spec manager..? nah not yet
        - so, steps:
            - snapshot what I've got into a commit
            - move spec loading into entity manager
            - make a render manager
            - move drawing from map manager into render manager
            - make entity manager register entities with render manager
            - make entity manager issue updates to renderer


- context passing
    - immediate execution + convoluted manager passage vs
        - e.g. using an init method
    - non-immediate execution + direct manager passage vs
    - .. some wonderful third option?
